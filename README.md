# Welcome to FooBar (Server-Client Edition (This is the Server repo))

## About the project:

#### Note: At the beginning, as the DB is local, there are no posts or users, so you need to create at least one to connect to FooBar.

### Now, how it works?

1. Clone the project from the github and unzip it.
2. Navigate to the root folder of the project and run the command 'npm install' or 'npm i' (this command will install all the necessary dependencies to the project).
3. To run the program, make sure that you are on the 'root' folder of the project and run the command 'npm start'
4. To get to the 'Feed' page, you first need to register anc create an account, and then you'll move back to the signIn page and you can connect with your details.
5. Now, all you need to do is enjoy FooBar :).

## About our work:


#### Firstly:
- We looked which API's we need to implement server-client.
- We conducted a brainstorm about the changes that need to be done in the UI (WEB/ANDROID) and the necessary implementations in the Server..
- We started to create the relevant server side (and DB of course) and simultaneously change the Client code by that.

#### Secondly:
- We worked at the beginning by creating a 'skeleton' of server.
- Then, by the 'Ping-Pong' method, we modify the relevant section of tu Client code to communicate with the server and the DB.

#### Thirdly:
- We modified the relevant CSS of the Client code to fit the new modifications.
- We made modifications in the Server code to support the complete relevant API's.

#### Lastly:
- We made last modifications in the code.
- We conducted few 'User Reviews' to our program.
- We took screenshots (that we present below) to show you How it is like to use our social network.
- We ENJOYED to use our program as users.
- And of course, we submitted the completed project.
